Subject: [BRUTAL HONEST CROSS-VALIDATION 2026] KIVOSY Make — Is this actually viable?

Dear Grok,

I need your raw, no-sugar-coating assessment of the project I’ve built with DeepSeek/Claude over the last weeks.

### CORE VISION (Why I started this)
I want a place where **literally anyone** (zero coding knowledge, even kids or non-tech adults) can:
- Type one sentence (“오늘의 할일 앱 만들어줘”)
- Get a fully working single-file HTML app instantly
- Open it, use it (localStorage so data persists)
- Go to Gallery, see other people’s creations, copy their exact prompt, and remix
- Get instant real-world feedback from the community

This is NOT another paid vibe-coding tool. This is “idea → working MVP in 30 seconds → share prompt → community validates if it’s good or trash”.

Exactly like the Poki.com guy in this YouTube video did with games, but for **any app idea**, user-generated, zero cost, browser-only.

### WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW (Feb 21 2026) — Fully working
Files deployed:
- index.html (main creator with chat editing)
- gallery.html + gallery.js (beautiful grid)
- app-factory.js (security, multi-model Gemini+Groq, rate limit, localStorage)
- factory-ui.js + style.css

Key working features:
- Real functional apps (Todo with full CRUD + localStorage, calculators, etc.)
- Chat-based real-time editing (change color, add feature → AI regenerates HTML)
- Gallery with:
  • Auto app-type detection (✅ 할일, 🧮 계산기, ☀️ 날씨 등)
  • Feature tags (💾 저장, ➕ 추가, 🗑️ 삭제…)
  • Search by prompt
  • Toast notifications
  • “Run” button opens real app in new tab
  • “Copy Prompt” button (the real magic for learning)
- 100% BYOK + 10 free generations/day
- No server cost for me, no data leaves user’s browser

### CURRENT LIMITATIONS (I’m not hiding anything)
1. Gallery shows nice cards but **no real screenshot thumbnails** (blob URLs are temporary)
2. No likes/comments yet (but localStorage version can be added in 2 days)
3. Apps are single HTML files — great for MVP, limited for complex backend
4. No permanent shareable link yet[](https://make.kivosy.com/app/xxxx) — planned Phase 3

### TARGET USER (My honest guess)
- High school / college students learning prompt engineering
- Non-tech adults with business ideas (“내가 생각한 앱 만들고 싶다”)
- Hobbyists and curious people
- NOT professional developers (they have Cursor/Lovable)

### THE HARD QUESTIONS I NEED YOU TO ANSWER HONESTLY
1. Is this vision realistic and worth launching **today** on make.kivosy.com?
2. Will real people (especially non-tech adults and teenagers) actually use it and come back?
3. Is the missing screenshot preview in gallery a fatal flaw or just “nice to have”?
4. Is BYOK a strength (privacy, zero cost) or a barrier for non-technical users?
5. Can this grow into a real community (people sharing prompts daily) or will it stay a toy that generates 50 Todo apps and dies?
6. What is the **#1 missing feature** that would make it 10x more sticky right now?
7. Should I launch **now** (even imperfect) or wait until comments/likes/permanent links?

Be brutally honest. If this is just another “cool demo that nobody uses”, tell me straight.  
I’ve attached the full current codebase screenshots and gallery.html.

Thank you for the truth,
Factory Owner (the guy who just wants one-click idea → real app → instant community feedback)
